# COMP4320
Objective 
The purpose of this assignment is to implement a simple Web service over the UDP transport service. You will write the Web client and server programs that will communicate over your own computer or the College of Engineering LAN. You will also learn other important functions in computer networks: (1) implementation of segmentation and re-assembly of long messages, (2) detecting errors in the received packets, and (3) emulation of packet errors generation and detection. Overview In this project you will implement a simple web client application, a simple web server application, the segmentation and re-assembly function, an error detection function and a gremlin function (that can corrupt packets with a specified probability).
